/*

  My first attempt at using templates and solving partial powers.
  Hasn't been fully tested but appears to work for all numbers.

  TODO:
  Make it more efficient such as optimising the recursive algorithm for pow
  and looking for a better way of calculating the root.
  (Bug) Ensure it handles negative number roots properly.
    - Looks like negative numbers are interesting.
      - Numbers between -1 and 1 can produce a real number and an imaginary number.
        - Numbers here seem to flip their sign based on the last +- 1 / n
      - Numbers less than -1 flip their sign after becoming lower than the last negative integer.
        - Make sure that happens for 0 and slightly less than 0.
  (Bug)  Currently Hangs on partial powers for negative numbers.
        Aw. Cmath doens't even calculate this. It just gives NaN.
        Time to look at implementing a pair of numbers of real and imaginary.
